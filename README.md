# Bootstrap Examples

This is a little repo just to show case some of the components I've made using Bootstrap. For each element there is a separate branch.

However notice that I'll using only Bootstrap. jQuery and Pooper.JS are also included, but just because they are required by Bootstrap. 

## How to use

You'll need `node` for this. Whatever version [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) support.

- `npm install`
- Switch to whichever branch you want to check
- `npm start`

As I'm using the same dependencies for all the examples, you don't need to reinstall when switching branches.
